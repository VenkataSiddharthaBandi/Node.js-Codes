/* Node.js is a Java Script run time environment
Generally Java Script runs only on Web Browser(Client side),
But with Node.js it can run on Server side without relying on any browser
Node.js is build by using Chromes V8 engine
By using Node.js we can do Server side actions like CRUD operations
Thats the brief introduction about Node.js
